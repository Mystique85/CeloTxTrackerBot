# CeloTxTrackerBot

A simple Proof of Ship project for the Celo ecosystem ðŸš€

## Overview
CeloTxTrackerBot is a lightweight tool that:
- Deploys a smart contract (`TxRegister.sol`) to Celo L1
- Allows users to register themselves on-chain
- Includes a Node.js bot that tracks outgoing transactions from a given address on Celo

This project demonstrates simple interactions with Celo L1 and is part of Proof of Ship participation.

## Project Milestones
1. Create Solidity smart contract `TxRegister`
2. Deploy contract on Celo mainnet (chainId 42220)
3. Build Node.js bot with ethers.js to track transactions
4. Integrate bot with Discord webhook (optional)

## How to Run
### Setup `.env` file
